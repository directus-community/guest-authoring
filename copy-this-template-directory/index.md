## Introduction
Directus allows a broad range of customization and extensibility. In this project, we will create full two-way syncing between items in Directus collection and Google Calendar Events. So, when the user creates/updates/deletes an item in Directus collection, the corresponding event in Google Calendar will be created/updated/deleted. And vice versa, when the user creates/updates/deletes an event in Google Calendar, the corresponding item will be created/updated/deleted in Directus collection. On the Directus side, we will use Flows, on the Google side, we will use Google Apps Script.

```
Google Apps Script, eh?

Allow me a citation from official docs https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview:
"Google Apps Script is a rapid application development platform that makes it fast and easy to create business applications
that integrate with Google Workspace. You write code in modern JavaScript and have access to built-in libraries for favorite
Google Workspace applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more.
There's nothing to installâ€”we give you a code editor right in your browser, and your scripts run on Google's servers."

And my personal opinion:
It's free, it's powerful, it's easy to use, have great docs, it has good resources quota, it has access to almost
all the things you can do in Gmail / Doc / Drive / Spreadsheet / Slide / Forms / Calendar.

```

&nbsp; 

## Before You Start
You will need a Directus project - check out [quickstart guide](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/quickstart) if you don't already have one. You will also need a Google Account.

**This project implementation limits:**
it does not support Directus Bulk operations. I only developed and tested it for the single item being created/updated/deleted.

&nbsp; 

## Interactions Scheme
on the high level, it might look simple
![](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_gcalendar_shapes_highlevel.svg "high level interactions scheme overview")

but the actual implementation looks a bit more complex

```
Sources of complexity:
- For proper syncing, we need to have some ID that is shared between Directus item and Google Calendar event.
This will be the ID of Google event, saved as an additional field in Directus item. So, in Flows, there will be actions
to update this ID with the value from Google Apps Script, and also actions to search Directus items by this ID.
- it's not very straightforward to organize a stream of updates from Google Calendar.
```

![](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_gcalendar_shapes__23-10-22%2019.16.17.svg "detailed interactions scheme overview")

1 - Flow set to react on create/update events in our _collection1_. Another flow set to react on delete events. Both send a signal to our Google Apps Script webapp (2).

3 - The same webapp (but a different function) sends signals to another Directus Flow, that creates/updates/deletes items in collection1 accordingly (4).

5 - Google Calendar can send push notifications when an event is added/updated/deleted, those notifications can be received directly by Google Apps Script webapp, but webapp cannot read request headers, so proxy Directus Flow (6) is used to modify request and send to webapp with parameters in the body (7).

8 - Google Apps Script has additional functions (cron to renew notifications, function to stop notifications, etc)

&nbsp; 

**Let's dive in.**

&nbsp; 

## Setup on Directus side
Directus collection (_collection1_ in this sample project) has these fields:

`calendar_event_id` - type text, where Google calendar event id will be saved (automatically)

`calendar_event_start` - type timestamp, where the event start date is

`calendar_event_end` - type timestamp, where the event end date is

`name` - type text, where the event title is

`description` - type text, where event description is

> `timestamp` type is available when the field is created in Advanced Mode. Could be Datetime type used instead? It might work, but since it doesn't have timezone info, you must ensure that your Directus and Google Calendar have the same timezone setting.

These fields are required, names could be changed, just ensure that you reflect these changes in the Google Spreadsheet Config

&nbsp; 

In the Flows, we will use [environment variables](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/config-options.html). Please add these two environment variables:

`GCALENDARHOOKSECRET=supersecretpass`

`GCALENDARHOOKURL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxx/exec`

First is the secret word our Flows will use to check that incoming data is from our trusted script, and the second is the actual URL of the published google apps script, you will acquire it later. In order for Flows to have access to variables, they need to be listed in another variable:

`FLOWS_ENV_ALLOW_LIST=GCALENDARHOOKSECRET,GCALENDARHOOKURL`

&nbsp; 

**Now a Flows.**

There are 4 Flows. For each Flow I'll show an overview picture and then each node screen with config also as text, so you can copy-paste it.

&nbsp; 

### Flow "Google Calendar event Proxy"

As I mentioned - it's not very straightforward to organize a stream of updates from Google Calendar with Google Apps Script.
We will use [push notifications](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/push) that will call our published Google Apps Script when there are changes in the calendar. The catch though, these push notifications provide data within Header but for incoming requests, Google Apps Script can't read headers, only the body. That's why we will use Directus Flow as a simple proxy, it's webhook URL will be registered as the address for push notifications, it will receive data, save the header as a body, and send it to our published Google Apps Script.

![whole flow](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_flow_1_full_.png "whole flow")

***

- Trigger node - webhook:

![trigger node](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_flow_1_01_.png "trigger node")


***

- Node 2 - "Webhook / Request URL"

![request node](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_flow_1_02_.png "request node")

URL is `{{$env.GCALENDARHOOKURL}}` - the actual value in the environment variable will be set after Google Apps Script is published.

Request body:
```js
{
  "headers": {{$trigger.headers}}
}
```

> note that {{$trigger.headers}} is not quoted!

After you save this Flow, copy the resulting webhook URL somewhere.

***

&nbsp; 

### Flow "Send delete event to Google Calendar"

Processing of the Delete event is a bit different from processing of Create / Update (next flow). It should be set to blocking, cause we need to "intercept" the delete command and read item data - we need to know the id of the Google Calendar event, so we can send it to Published Google Apps Script.

![whole flow](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_flow_2_full_.png "whole flow")

***

- Trigger node - Event Hook

![trigger node](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_flow_2_01_.png "trigger node")

make sure that you have the same config:

Type - Filter(Blocking)

Scope - items.delete

Collections - a collection of your choice

Response - data of last operation


***

- Node 2 - "Read data"

![node 02](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_flow_2_02_.png "node 02")

IDs edit raw value to:
```js
[
    "{{$trigger.payload[0]}}"
]
```
Query is empty


***

- Node 3 - "Webhook / Request URL"

![node 03](/copy-this-template-directory/directus_flow_2_03_.png "node 03")

URL is `{{$env.GCALENDARHOOKURL}}` - the actual value in the environment variable will be set after Google Apps Script is published.

Method is Post

Request body:
```js
{
  "data": {{$last}},
  "action": "delete",
  "pass": "{{$env.GCALENDARHOOKSECRET}}"
}

```

> note that {{$last}} is not quoted!

***

&nbsp; 
 
### Flow "Send create/update event to Google Calendar"
Processing of Create / Update is more complicated than Delete, cause after we send this event info, we might receive the id of the Google Calendar Event that was created and we must update the current Directus item with this ID. This operation is not blocking.

## Setup in Google side

[Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview) is usually enabled by default, but if you are using Google Workspace within organization, your Admin might disable Google Apps Script.

Google Apps Script can be created as dedicated file (Drive â†’ New â†’ More â†’ Google Apps Script).

But for this project we will use Script within Spreadsheet. That way it is easier to use spreadsheet for config and for logging.

For quicker setup, please use [this spreadsheet template copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QSKNNqRbpVBW1OAYg_8kWOCbK4RAM8FwAL8D701LEdY/copy), it have script inside.

In yours spreadsheet copy, open menu Extensions â†’ Apps Script. It will open Script Editor.

Click button "Deploy" â†’ New Deployment

Web app

Execute as - Me (info@flowmata.com)

Who has access - Anyone

Click Deploy, then "Authorize Access". Choose your account and then click "Allow"

Some users (usually, users not within organization) will see a scary looking

"Google hasnâ€™t verified this app
The app is requesting access to sensitive info in your Google Account. Until the developer (your email) verifies this app with Google, you shouldn't use it."

Click "Advanced"

Then click "Go to code (unsafe)"
